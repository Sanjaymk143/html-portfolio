    <h3>Friends</h3>
    <p>It is such a heartwarming comedy venture and a story about six people living in NYC. It feels connected to me like I'm on FRIENDS.</p><br />
    <h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
    <p>It is a great world with treachery. It has a massive storyline created by George R.R Martin where there is a brutal world with no TRUST.</p><br />
    <h3>The American Office</h3>
    <p>This is a mockumentary where the characters had a fun ride for years. They also make me happy whenever i see it.</p>
